# Assembly-Arrays

# This program will use a static array of integers and 
#	two dynamic arrays. One of the dynamic arrays will read 
#	input to fill the array. Then the two full arrays will be
#	added together index by index. both arrays will be printed
#	to the console. The third array will hold the sums of the 
#	first twi arrays and will be printed backwards before the 
#	program ends.
